## 🔧 BACKEND (To Be Developed)
**Future Location**: `C:\Users\DELL\OneDrive\Desktop\Up And Win\delivery-app-backend`
**Technology**: Django + PostgreSQL + Redis
**Status**: 🔄 **PENDING** - Ready to begin development

### **Backend Responsibilities**
- REST API endpoints
- Database management
- Business logic processing
- Authentication & authorization
- Real-time WebSocket connections
- Payment processing
- Image/file storage
- Background task processing
- Admin panel (web-based)

### **Backend Components Needed**
🔄 Django REST Framework setup
🔄 User authentication system
🔄 Multi-role user management
🔄 Restaurant and menu management
🔄 Order processing system
🔄 Payment integration (Stripe/PayPal)
🔄 Real-time notifications (WebSocket)
🔄 GPS tracking for delivery
🔄 File upload for images
🔄 Admin web dashboard

## 🔗 Integration Points

### **API Communication**
```
📱 FRONTEND                    🔧 BACKEND
React Native App     ←→       Django REST API
├─ Login Screen      ←→       /api/auth/login
├─ Restaurant List   ←→       /api/restaurants
├─ Order Placement   ←→       /api/orders
├─ Real-time Updates ←→       WebSocket /ws/orders
└─ Push Notifications ←→      Firebase/APNs
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **Authentication**: Frontend sends credentials → Backend validates → Returns JWT token
2. **Data Fetching**: Frontend requests data → Backend queries database → Returns JSON
3. **Real-time**: Backend pushes updates → WebSocket → Frontend updates UI
4. **File Uploads**: Frontend captures image → Sends to backend → Backend saves to storage
