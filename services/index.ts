/**
 * Service Layer Architecture Overview:
 * 
 * 1. cartService - Complete cart management with items, promos, and totals
 * 2. favoritesService - Restaurant and menu item favorites with real-time sync
 * 3. ordersService - Full order lifecycle from placement to delivery tracking
 * 4. quickActionsService - Handler for all quick action operations with modals
 * 5. restaurantService - Restaurant data, menu items, search, and filtering
 * 6. locationService - User location, delivery addresses, and distance calculations
 * 7. userService - Authentication, profile management, preferences, and payments
 * 8. notificationService - In-app notifications, push notifications, and settings
 * 9. authService - Multi-role authentication (Customer, Restaurant, Delivery, Admin)
 * 10. restaurantManagementService - Restaurant operations and business management
 * 11. deliveryManagementService - Delivery rider operations and earnings tracking
 * 12. paymentService - Payment processing, methods, transactions, and wallet management
 * 13. adminManagementService - Platform administration, user oversight, and analytics
 * 14. realTimeNotificationService - Real-time push notifications and event broadcasting
 * 
 * Each service follows these patterns:
 * - Singleton pattern for consistent state
 * - Observer pattern with subscribe/notify for real-time updates
 * - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
 * - Mock data for development and testing
 * - Error handling and validation
 * - Real-world functionality simulation
